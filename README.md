# DSA-Journey
This repository contains my Data Structures and Algorithms practice solutions. I am solving problems from different coding platforms and organizing them topic-wise. It includes arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming. The goal is to improve problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews.
